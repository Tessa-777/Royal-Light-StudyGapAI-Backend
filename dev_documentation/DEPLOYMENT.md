## Deploying StudyGapAI Backend

### Legacy: Railway Deployment (Deprecated)

Railway free tier has frequent build timeouts. We recommend using Render.com instead.

For Railway deployment (if needed):
- See old Railway docs in git history
- Or upgrade to Railway paid tier

**Recommended**: Use Render.com - faster builds, more reliable free tier.
