## 🧠 AI Logic Overview

1. **Analyze Diagnostic:**
   Gemini processes quiz responses and returns:

   * Topic strengths & weaknesses
   * Projected score
   * Recommended improvement areas

2. **Generate Study Plan:**
   Based on diagnostics, the AI builds:

   * Week-by-week study schedule
   * Recommended resources
   * Goal tracking roadmap

---

## 🧑‍💻 Example API Flow

```bash
# Start quiz
POST /api/quiz/start
→ returns quizId and question list

# Submit answers
POST /api/quiz/{quizId}/submit
→ saves responses and calculates raw score

# Get AI analysis
POST /api/ai/analyze-diagnostic
→ returns topic-level feedback and recommendations

# Get study plan
POST /api/ai/generate-study-plan
→ returns custom plan JSON
```

## 🎨 UI Concept (optional demo)

* Dashboard showing current progress and AI insights
* Study planner with upcoming goals
* Resource list dynamically filtered by weak topics
